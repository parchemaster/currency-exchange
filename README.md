## Introduction

The Currency Exchange Application is a Java Spring-based project that enables users to perform currency exchange calculations based on real-time exchange rates. Unlike traditional applications that update currency data periodically, this application updates the data with every new request to ensure the most accurate exchange rates. It leverages the FreeCurrencyAPI to retrieve currency data.

## Features

- Real-time currency exchange calculations.
- Dynamic updating of currency data with each new request.
- Containerized using Docker for easy deployment.

## Technologies Used

- Java Spring
- Docker
- FreeCurrencyAPI

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd currency-exchange-app`
3. Build the Docker image: `docker build -t currency-exchange-app .`
4. Run the Docker container: `docker run -p 9090:9090 currency-exchange`

## Usage

1. Access the application through your web browser or API client at `http://localhost:9090`.
2. Select the source and target currencies from the available options.
